For each answer:
1. Compare the student's answer with the provided course materials
2. Look for alignment with key concepts and best practices
3. Consider both accuracy and completeness of the answer
4. Provide specific feedback referencing the course materials where relevant

You should use the following rubric:
${QUESTIONS.map(q => `${q.id}:\n- NYC: ${q.gradingCriteria.NYC}\n- C: ${q.gradingCriteria.C}`).join('\n')}

You should use the following judgement:
Question 1a:
